# Product Extraction from Furniture Store Websites
## Project Overview
This project is aimed at developing a solution capable of extracting product information from various furniture store websites. The solution includes building a Named Entity Recognition (NER) model that identifies product names and a simple single-page web application where users can input a URL to extract and display the product names found on the webpage.

## Input
The input consists of a list of URLs from furniture store websites. While most URLs will contain product information, some might not, and others may be non-functional. The list of URLs is provided via a downloadable file.

## Output
The expected output is a single-page web application where a user can input a URL, and the application will return a list of product names extracted from the webpage.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the feasibility of extracting product information from furniture websites using a custom NER model. The solution is scalable and can be adapted to handle other types of entities or product categories by re-training the model with the appropriate data.
